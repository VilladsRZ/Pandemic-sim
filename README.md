# Pandemic_sim
 
Class Parameters: <br>
N                  --> sets the population size at N*N <br>
duration           --> sets the time for the simulation (in days) <br>
r_0                --> sets the initial population infection <br>
infection_rate     --> sets the average chance for infection at encounter <br>
mortality_rate:    --> sets the chance for the individual to expire at when infected <br>
sociability:       --> sets the social-sphere of each person. A value of 1 is every adjecent individual, a value of 2 extends this perimeter by 1 and so on <br>
transmission_time  --> sets the amount of time an individual can transmit the disease after infection <br>
imunity_time       --> sets the amount of time of an individual is imune after recovery <br>
